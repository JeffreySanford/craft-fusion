## Integration Patterns

The services in this application follow several common integration patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Most services are provided at the root level for application-wide access
2. **Facade Pattern**: Many services expose simple interfaces that abstract complex operations
3. **Observable Pattern**: Services use RxJS observables for reactive state management
4. **Adapter Pattern**: Third-party integrations wrap external APIs in consistent interfaces
5. **Proxy Pattern**: Used for caching, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns
