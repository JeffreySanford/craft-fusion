### Performance Benchmarks

**Small Dataset (100 records)**
- NestJS: 500ms generation, 120ms delivery
- Go: 150ms generation, 30ms delivery

**Medium Dataset (10,000 records)**
- NestJS: 3200ms generation, 850ms delivery
- Go: 800ms generation, 250ms delivery

**Large Dataset (100,000 records)**
- NestJS: 28000ms generation, chunked delivery
- Go: 5500ms generation, chunked delivery

**Very Large Dataset (1,000,000 records)**
- NestJS: Not recommended
- Go: 52000ms generation, chunked delivery

### Server Selection Guidelines

- **Choose NestJS Server when:**
  - Working with TypeScript codebase
  - Leveraging existing Node.js ecosystem
  - Requiring built-in SSR capabilities
  - Development speed is prioritized over raw performance
  - Working with small to medium datasets (<10,000 records)

- **Choose Go Server when:**
  - Processing large datasets (>10,000 records)
  - Requiring minimal memory footprint
  - Optimizing for concurrent connections
  - Deploying to resource-constrained environments
  - Performance is critical for your application

## Memory Management System

The table system implements optimized memory management with the following strategies:

1. **Chunked Data Loading**: Records are loaded in configurable chunks (default: 20 records per chunk)
2. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Continuous JS heap size monitoring
3. **Garbage Collection Triggers**: Automatic GC requests when memory usage exceeds 80% of available heap
4. **Data Compaction**: Removal of unnecessary cached data
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup when navigating away from data-intensive routes
6. **Progressive Rendering**: Only visible records are fully rendered in the DOM
7. **Virtual Scrolling**: For datasets exceeding 1,000 records
8. **Deferred Loading**: Non-essential data fields load only when needed
9. **Component Lifecycle Management**: Resources are properly disposed during component destruction
## Memory Management System

Default memory estimates:
- Small record set (<1,000): ~5MB
- Medium record set (1,000-10,000): ~50MB
- Large record set (10,000-100,000): ~300MB+
- Extremely large record set (100,000-1,000,000): ~1.5GB+
- Breaking record set (Javascript limitations: >3M): Exceeds browser memory limits (3GB+)
## Future Enhancement: Server-Side Data Processing

### Overview
To address the challenges of datasets too large for efficient client-side handling (typically >50,000 records), a server-side data processing system is planned for Q3 2025. This approach will eliminate the need to transfer complete datasets to the client, significantly improving performance and user experience.

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Architecture
- **Streaming Data Pipeline**: Implement Observable/BehaviorSubject pattern to stream only required data chunks
- **Server-Side Table Operations**: Move sorting, filtering, and aggregation operations to the server
- **Data Snapshot Management**: Maintain server-side state of user's current view
- **WebSocket Real-Time Updates**: Push filtered/sorted data changes to connected clients

#### Frontend-Backend Communication
- **Request Parameters Schema**:
    ```typescript
    interface TableStateRequest {
        pageIndex: number;
        pageSize: number;
        sortBy: { field: string; direction: 'asc' | 'desc' }[];
        filters: { field: string; operator: FilterOperator; value: any }[];
        viewportStart: number;
        viewportEnd: number;
    }
    ```

### Adaptive Rendering Decision System

| Dataset Size | Processing Approach | Load Strategy |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| <10,000 records | Client-side | Full dataset |
| 10,000-50,000 | Client-side | Chunked loading |
| 50,000-1M | Server-side | Viewport-only data |
| >1M | Server-side | Aggregated summaries |

### Real-Time Progress Visualization

- Replace traditional progress spinners with information-rich progress UI:
    - Record count processed/total
    - Current memory utilization
    - Time remaining estimation
    - Processing phases (data fetching, filtering, sorting, rendering)
    - Preview of initial records while processing continues

### Impact on Current Table System

- **Sorting**: Will transparently switch between client/server implementations
- **Filtering**: Complex filters will execute on server for large datasets
- **Pagination**: Will function identically with either approach
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Enhanced with server-side windowing support
- **State Management**: Table state persistence regardless of processing location

### Performance Expectations

| Operation | Current System (100K) | With Server Processing (100K) | With Server Processing (1M) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Initial Load | 15-30 seconds | 1-2 seconds | 2-3 seconds |
| Sort Operation | 3-5 seconds | 300-500ms | 500-800ms |
| Filter Application | 2-4 seconds | 200-400ms | 400-600ms |
| Page Navigation | 100-200ms | 100-200ms | 100-200ms |
| Memory Usage | 300MB+ | 10-20MB | 10-20MB |
## Working with Large Datasets

For optimal performance with large datasets (>10,000 records):

1. Use the Go server backend (`apiService.setApiUrl('Go')`)
2. Enable progressive loading with chunk size configuration
3. Implement virtual scrolling for table rendering
4. Configure appropriate memory limits
5. Disable real-time updates when displaying large datasets

```typescript
// Configure for optimal large dataset performance
tablePreparationService.configureForLargeDataset({
  chunkSize: 50,
  memoryThreshold: 200, // MB
  useVirtualScroll: true,
  enableRealTimeUpdates: false
});

// Load data progressively with progress tracking
tablePreparationService.loadDataProgressively(100000).subscribe({
  next: data => {
    // Process data chunks as they arrive
    console.log(`Loaded ${data.length} records so far`);
  },
  error: err => console.error('Error loading data:', err),
  complete: () => console.log('All data loaded successfully')
});
```

## Getting Started with Servers

To use the dual-server approach:

```typescript
// Switch to NestJS server
apiService.setApiUrl('Nest');

// Switch to Go server
apiService.setApiUrl('Go');

// Get performance metrics
apiService.getPerformanceDetails();
```

## New Features (as of May 2025)

- **Automatic Server Selection**: Smart switching between Go/Nest based on data size
- **Memory Usage Dashboard**: New admin panel showing real-time memory metrics
- **Enhanced Cache Management**: Improved cache invalidation strategies
- **Dataset Snapshot**: Export/import large dataset state between sessions
- **Partial Updates**: Support for delta updates to large datasets
- **Enhanced Logging**: Patriotic-themed performance metrics visualization
- **Progressive Table Rendering**: Optimized DOM updates for large tables

## Known Issues

1. Memory spikes when loading datasets larger than 500,000 records
2. UI becomes unresponsive during initial load of very large datasets
3. Backend API timeouts possible with extremely large generation requests
4. Safari browser has rendering issues with virtual scrolling
5. Desktop performance significantly better than mobile for large datasets
