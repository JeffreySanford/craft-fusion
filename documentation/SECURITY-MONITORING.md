# SECURITY MONITORING (2025 Vibrant Edition)

This project provides both real-time and scheduled security monitoring for compliance and operational assurance.

## üåà Real-Time Monitoring: `fedramp-monitor.sh` & `memory-monitor.sh`
- **Location:** `scripts/fedramp-monitor.sh`, `scripts/memory-monitor.sh`
- **Purpose:** Continuously checks key technical FedRAMP controls and system health, with vibrant color-coded output.
- **How to Run:**
  ```bash
  sudo bash scripts/fedramp-monitor.sh
  bash scripts/memory-monitor.sh
  ```
- **All monitoring scripts now source `system-prep.sh` for consistent system prep.**

### Example Vibrant Compliance Output
```text
üõ°Ô∏è  OSCAL/FedRAMP Compliance Scan:
   ‚úì OpenSCAP scan found for standard (2 days ago)
   Pass: 120  Fail: 0  N/A: 5  Total: 125
```

## Scheduled Full Baseline Scans: `fedramp-oscal.sh`

- **Location:** `scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh`
- **Purpose:** Runs OpenSCAP (oscap) with the appropriate SCAP Security Guide profile for Fedora, generating results and HTML reports in `oscal-analysis/`.
- **How to Run (Standard Profile):**
  ```bash
  sudo bash scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh standard
  ```
- **How to Run (Other Profiles):**
  - `sudo bash scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh ospp` (for OSPP profile)
  - `sudo bash scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh pci-dss` (for PCI-DSS profile)
  - `sudo bash scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh cusp` (for CUSP profile)
- **Output:**
  - Results: `oscal-analysis/oscap-results.xml`
  - HTML Report: `oscal-analysis/oscap-report.html`

### Example Cron Job (Weekly Scan)

Add to root's crontab (`sudo crontab -e`):
```
0 3 * * 0 /usr/bin/bash /path/to/scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh standard
```

## OSCAL Data Storage
- The latest scan results and reports are stored in the root `oscal-analysis/` directory by default.
- You may wish to archive these to a more permanent location for compliance evidence.

## Extending Monitoring
- To add more real-time technical controls, expand `fedramp-monitor.sh`.
- For more comprehensive compliance, use OpenSCAP with the full SCAP Security Guide content.

# FedRAMP/OSCAL Compliance Scanning

## Overview
This project includes automated scripts for running OpenSCAP (oscap) compliance scans using multiple security profiles. These scans help ensure your Fedora server meets security baselines for FedRAMP, PCI-DSS, OSPP, and custom requirements.

## OSCAL Scan Profiles
- **standard**: Baseline security (recommended for most)
- **ospp**: Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems
- **pci-dss**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **cusp**: Custom User Security Profile (Fedora-specific)

## How to Run a Scan
Run any scan with:

```
sudo ./scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh [standard|ospp|pci-dss|cusp]
```

- Results are saved in `./oscal-analysis/oscap-results-<profile>.xml` and `oscap-report-<profile>.html`.
- The `memory-monitor.sh` and `fedramp-monitor.sh` scripts will show the status and summary of all available scans.

## Interpreting Results
- **Pass/Fail counts** are shown for each scan in the monitors.
- Review the HTML report for detailed findings and remediation guidance.

## Example Usage
```
sudo ./scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh standard
sudo ./scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh ospp
sudo ./scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh pci-dss
sudo ./scripts/fedramp-oscal.sh cusp
```

## Automation
- The `fedramp-monitor.sh` script will alert if a recent scan is missing and can be extended to auto-run scans if needed.
- The `deploy-all.sh` script can be configured to require a passing scan before deployment.

## Requirements
- `openscap`, `scap-security-guide`, and (optionally) `xmllint` for pass/fail summaries.

# System & Security Monitoring

- Use `memory-monitor.sh` for live system health, memory, and compliance status.
- Use `fedramp-monitor.sh` for compliance and security control checks.
- All scripts provide vibrant, colorized summaries and time estimates for each step.

# TrueNorth OSCAL Integration

## New Files
- **truenorth-oscal-test.sh**: Validates the new TrueNorth OSCAL profile and test files for real-time, Rev5, and 3PAO/3FAO compliance.
- **truenorth-template.json**: OSCAL template for TrueNorth real-time, audit-ready Rev5 profile.
- **truenorth-test.json**: Test case for TrueNorth OSCAL profile.

## Usage
- Run `truenorth-oscal-test.sh` to validate your OSCAL files against the TrueNorth profile.
- Integrate these files and tests into your deployment pipeline to ensure continuous compliance.
