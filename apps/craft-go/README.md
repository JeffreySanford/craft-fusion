This is the Go implementation of the Craft Fusion API.

## Development Guidelines

### Package Management

> **Important**: This application follows monorepo architecture principles. 
> - While Go uses go.mod for dependencies, JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies 
>   should only be managed at the root of the monorepo
> - **DO NOT** create a package.json file in this directory
> - Any Node.js tooling needed for this application must be added to the root package.json
