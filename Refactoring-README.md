## Scope & Purpose
Refactoring efforts mainly focus on the frontend (craft-web) for Material Design 3 compliance, consistent patriotic theming, component architecture improvements, and performance optimizations.

## Refactoring Efforts

### Style Refactoring
- Guided by [style-refactoring-plan.md](./prompts/style-refactoring-plan.md)
- Objective: Adopt MD3 tokens, create a unified SCSS structure, and test across components
- Status: In Testing (60%) — finalizing responsive checks and accessibility compliance

### Footer Refactoring
- Guided by [footer-refactoring-plan.md](./prompts/footer-refactoring-plan.md)
- Objective: Align footer with MD3 and unify performance metrics display
- Status: Analysis Complete (15%) — preparing new service-based architecture

### Header Refactoring
- Guided by [header-refactoring-plan.md](./prompts/header-refactoring-plan.md)
- Objective: Modernize header layout, search/notification features, and MD3 integration
- Status: Analysis Complete (15%) — building container/presentation components

### Sidebar Refactoring
- Guided by [sidebar-refactoring-plan.md](./prompts/sidebar-refactoring-plan.md)
- Objective: Make navigation consistent with MD3, add multi-level navigation, improve responsiveness
- Status: Analysis Complete (15%) — subcomponent design underway

### Data Visualization System
- Guided by [data-visualization-plan.md](./prompts/data-visualization-plan.md)
- Objective: Standardize chart components with a patriotic theme and MD3 norms
- Status: Planning (5%) — evaluating library options and designing core chart APIs

### Feature Refactoring Strategy
- Guided by [feature-refactoring-strategy.md](./prompts/feature-refactoring-strategy.md)
- Objective: Promote a prompt-driven approach to track major features, decisions, and status
- Status: Complete (100%) — used as the framework for all new prompt files

## Primary Goals
1. Ensure full Material Design 3 compliance
2. Maintain a cohesive, patriotic color theme
3. Improve core component architecture
4. Enhance performance and accessibility
5. Provide clear prompt-driven documentation for each effort

## Current Status Summary
• Style System: 60% complete — nearing animation system integration  
• Footer, Header, Sidebar: Each 15% complete — moving from analysis to implementation phases  
• Data Visualization: 5% complete — library selection and early planning  
• Feature Refactoring Strategy: 100% — established as standard practice
