# Footer Component Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to refactor the application footer to align with Material Design 3 principles and improve its integration with the core styling system.

## Current State Analysis
- Footer uses a mix of custom styles and Material Design principles
- Contains performance metrics visualization that needs special handling
- Has hard-coded color values and dimensions
- Contains service call monitoring functionality
- Currently handles its own responsive behavior

## Goals
- Migrate to full Material Design 3 compliance
- Extract reusable styles to core style modules
- Maintain all current functionality
- Improve accessibility and performance
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

## ✅ Step 1: Analyze Current Implementation
- Identify all hard-coded style values
- Document current component behavior and patterns
- Catalog all dependencies and service integrations
- Identify animation patterns and transition effects
- Document current responsive behavior

## [ ] Step 2: Refactor Component Structure
- Separate display logic from data collection
- Implement container/presentation component pattern
- Move complex logic to dedicated services
- Improve template structure with semantic elements

## [ ] Step 3: Apply MD3 Styling
- Replace custom styles with MD3 tokens from core styles
- Apply MD3 elevation principles for cards and containers
- Implement MD3-compliant interactive elements
- Use proper MD3 spacing via the 8px grid system
- Apply patriotic theme consistently

## [ ] Step 4: Implement Responsive Behavior
- Use flexbox and grid from core layout system
- Ensure proper stacking on mobile devices
- Adjust visualization size based on viewport
- Implement collapsible sections for small screens
- Test across all breakpoints

## [ ] Step 5: Optimize Performance
- Move animation logic to the animation service
- Use OnPush change detection strategy
- Implement proper unsubscribe patterns
- Reduce DOM manipulation
- Optimize performance metric collection

## [ ] Step 6: Enhance Accessibility
- Ensure semantic HTML structure
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Verify color contrast
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

## [ ] Step 7: Testing and Documentation
- Create unit tests for all logic
- Test responsive behavior
- Document styling patterns
- Create usage examples
- Add performance benchmarks

## Detailed Task List

### Component Structure Tasks
- [ ] Create FooterPresentation and FooterContainer components
- [ ] Move data collection to dedicated service
- [ ] Create interfaces for all data models
- [ ] Implement proper lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring service

### Styling Tasks
- [ ] Remove all inline styles
- [ ] Replace hard-coded colors with MD3 tokens
- [ ] Apply proper typography classes
- [ ] Set up elevation using MD3 standards
- [ ] Implement proper spacing using the grid system
- [ ] Create animation patterns using core animations

### Performance Monitoring Tasks
- [ ] Create reusable chart components
- [ ] Move metrics collection to background service
- [ ] Implement efficient rendering for charts
- [ ] Add toggleable metrics display
- [ ] Create performance dashboard component

### Service Integration Tasks
- [ ] Create proper service interfaces
- [ ] Implement efficient subscription patterns
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Create mock services for testing
- [ ] Document service integration patterns

## Style Migration Plan

The following component-specific styles should be moved to core style modules:

1. Metric visualization styles → `_data-visualization.scss`
2. Footer card styles → `_layout.scss`
3. Status indicator styles → `_utilities.scss`
4. Network and CPU indicator styles → `_utilities.scss`
5. Footer animations → `_animations.scss`

### Vibrant Patriotic Colors
Ensure the footer respects our updated color palette:
- Red: #B22234
- Navy: #002868
- Gold: #FFD700
- White: #FFFFFF

## Coding Standards
Refer to [CODING-STANDARDS.md](../CODING-STANDARDS.md) for updated development guidelines.

## Testing Criteria
- Component renders correctly in all themes
- All metrics display properly
- Responsive behavior works across devices
- Animations respect reduced motion preferences
- All interactive elements are accessible
- Performance is improved or maintained

## Done Criteria
- All component-specific styles moved to core styles where possible
- Fully compliant with MD3 specifications
- All tests passing
- Reduced CSS specificity
- Improved performance metrics
- Documented in the style guide
