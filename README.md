### ‚ú® Learn as You Build

Our documentation isn't just static text ‚Äì it's a living resource that grows with the project! 

> üî• **HOT TIP**: Navigate to http://jeffreysanford.us/docs for the latest interactive documentation with live examples!

### üìä Visual Learning with Interactive Examples

The documentation includes interactive diagrams, code snippets you can run directly in your browser, and performance visualizations that showcase real-time metrics.

### üõ† Craft Your Understanding

Like the project itself, our documentation embraces a craft mentality ‚Äì building knowledge piece by piece with practical examples and clear guidance.

## üìà Performance Testing

Compare the performance of our dual backend implementations:

```bash
# Generate 100,000 records with NestJS
curl http://localhost:3000/api/records/generate?count=100000

# Generate 100,000 records with Go
curl http://localhost:4000/records/generate?count=100000

# Benchmark retrieval performance
time curl http://localhost:3000/api/records?limit=10000
time curl http://localhost:4000/records?limit=10000
```

> **Message to Junior Developers:** I intentionally keep this repository public so you can freely use whatever code you find helpful‚Äîafter all, I learned the same way! Real coding isn't about perfection; it's about writing, breaking, and fixing code thousands of times. That grueling, nerve-wracking process of trial and error is truly the only way to learn. So fork away, break things, and build your own solutions!
